# JumpKing Recreation Project

## 📖 Overview
This project is a recreation of the platformer game **JumpKing**, developed collaboratively with a partner as part of a programming/project assignment.  
The goal was to **replicate core gameplay mechanics** while improving coding skills and understanding game development principles, including movement physics, collision detection, and level design.

## 🎮 How to Play
**Objective:** Navigate the character through levels by jumping accurately to reach the goal platform without falling.  

### Gameplay Overview
1. Control the character using the keyboard (e.g., arrow keys or WASD).  
2. Time your jumps carefully to land on platforms.  
3. Falling off a platform will restart the level.  
4. Levels increase in difficulty with more challenging jumps and obstacles.  
5. The game ends when the player reaches the final platform.  

##🧩 What I Learned
1.Collaborated effectively with a partner to develop a complex game project.
2.Implemented movement physics, collision detection, and level progression.
3.Improved understanding of game structure, debugging, and iterative development.
4.Gained experience in project version control using GitHub.

##🔮 Future Improvements
1.Expanded Levels: Add more levels with unique challenges and obstacles.
2.Import Graphics & Audio: Adding visual appeal and sound effects.
3.Scoring & Metrics: Track jumps, time, or retries for competitive gameplay.
4.Power-ups or Interactive Elements: Add items or obstacles to increase engagement.

## 🧰 How to Run
1. Ensure your environment is set up (e.g., Python 3, Pygame, or your project’s framework).  
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Run the main file:  
```bash
python main.py
